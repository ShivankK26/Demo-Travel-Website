<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
To get started, first of all go to the official site of Bootstrap and copy the CDN Links then proceed by pasting them in your html file. 

## Installation
After pasting the CDN Links, we will use various features in Bootstrap such as Carousel, Buttons, Cards, Gutters, and much more.

* CDN Links
